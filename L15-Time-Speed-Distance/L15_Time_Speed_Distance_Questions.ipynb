        "Time taken by A to complete one round = 6000/5=1200 s\n",
        "Time taken by B to complete one round = 6000/10=600 s\n",
        "Time taken by C to complete one round = 6000/20=300 s\n",
        "So they will be together again for the 1st time at the starting point after:  LCM (1200, 600, 300) = 1200 s. Hence, option (a) is correct."
